"Hello, welcome to Helbreath
You look like you need some 
help. Your bag (F6) has a few
things to help you on your way
some health potions (red), 
mana potions (blue) and some 
stamina potions (green). Stamina 
will help you run. To move around
click and hold the mouse down. To
run you can press control R. I
recommend you read through some
of the things in the F1 menu to
help you setup your character &
tell you about how to attack things!"
